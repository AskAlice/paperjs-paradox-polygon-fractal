# Paper.js Paradox Fractal

this is a very simple paper.js demo/toy. Every frame it will draw a polygon. It will do some math and make each poly slightly smaller, then rotate it until it intersects with the previous polygon. It creates a spiral-like structure.

Some images I've made with this:

To control it:

- up/down control number of sides on polygon
- left/right control amplitude of sine wave that controls the change in size of each polygon. It will change the speed of the animation. Use f12 to see what the current value is. It's not flashing because the speed is changing so much, it's flashing because the sine wave is translating.
- ctrl/shift to control the size of the polygon


have fun
